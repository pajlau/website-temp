## Important legal note for everyone who came there:
The project itself is the project requested from me for college. You can take it, modify it, and use it for your own college project if you want. I don't really care about rights and credits, but if your teacher/professor doesn't care you can credit me as the original author/idea giver. Thanks!

## Couple exceptions:
**If the code will be used publicly, shared publicly at any point. You are required to attach a copy of the license and copyright notice which must be included with the licensed material as stated in MIT License.**

## Translations:
I'm not going to translate all the comments and/or other things called in polish language, since it's just a college project for someone else. If you are willing to translate, submit a pull request.

## Anything else:
For anything else, submit an issue. I might fix anything that is done wrong. If you want to fix it yourself, submit a pull request.

## Website preview:
Don't ask about cats... It's just been the easiest choice.
